# x) Name Based Virtual Host Support

## Name-based host

- Relies on the client (browser) to report the hostname as part of the HTTP headers
- This way, Host (server) can have many domain names on a single IP address
- Usually simpler, need only to configure DNS server to map each hostname to the correct IP address, <br>
  and then configure the Apache HTTP Server to recognize the different hostnames
- Eases the demand for scarce IP addressess
